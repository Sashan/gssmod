This patch adds an option/flag FirewallClearCommandChannel to yafc for Kerberos 4/5
 connections to e.g. proftpd. Stateful firewalls need to intercept the PORT or 
PASV command to be able to setup their session tables. 
The flag has to be set in the yafcrc file.
The result of the flag is that the client sends the PORT/PASV command unprotected and the server replies with an unprotected message.


Overall this solutions is more secure then opening on the firewall a port range.
